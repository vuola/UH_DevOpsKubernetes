## Headless service configuration

<clusterIP: None>
 
This is a version created later and running OK in GKE.
With a local k3d I did not manage to make the **headless**
service (ClusterIP: None) work but this version works
in Google cloud. It was created later so it has all
the features required for project v.1.4.2
